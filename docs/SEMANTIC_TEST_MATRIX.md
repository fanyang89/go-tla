# Semantic regression matrix

This matrix describes executable evidence, not a proof of full Go semantics.
Paths and test names refer to the current implementation. Actual TLC tests are
optional in a plain local test run but mandatory in the
[strict gate](VERIFICATION.md#tests-and-required-ci-gate).

## Frontend, abstraction, and artifact contracts

| Contract | Evidence | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| Typed primitive recognition and call graph | `internal/discovery/primitives_test.go`: `TestRecognizeTypedSSAPrimitives` | Recognize real SSA operations and include the worker in the static call graph |
| Conservative backward control/data slice | `internal/slice/concurrency_test.go`: `TestBackwardControlAndData` | Preserve control and dependencies leading to communication |
| Cyclic control detection | Same file: `TestCycleDetection` | Reachable cycle recognized, not silently truncated |
| Constant vs unknown predicates | `internal/abstract/predicates_test.go`: `TestPredicateConstantAndNondeterminism` | Constants retained; unknown predicate represented as choice |
| Trusted returns and static closures | `tests/analysis_test.go`: `TestTrustedResultAndStaticClosure` | Unknown result remains abstract and send survives; static closure supported |
| Sequential region collapse | Same file: `TestExamplesAndSnapshots` | Unbuffered and sequential examples each retain five IR transitions |
| Reproducibility | Same file: `TestDiagnosticsAndIRDeterministic` | Two independent analyses of each of eight examples yield equal IR/diagnostics/TLA/config |
| Artifact and size baselines | Same file: `TestExamplesAndSnapshots`; `internal/behavior/statistics_test.go` | IR/TLA snapshots match; eight-example size snapshot matches; counts reflect IR, not TLC states |
| Backend-only IR consumption | `internal/tla/generator_test.go`: `TestGenerateBackendIndependentModel` | Generate from a hand-built behavioral model without SSA |
| Unsupported backend features | Same file: `TestRejectUnknownIREffect`, `TestRejectMultipleSchedulingEffects` | Refuse unknown effects and multiple scheduling effects in a transition |
| CLI outcomes/artifact safety | `cmd/gotla/main_test.go`: `TestCLIAnalyzeInspectAndStaleArtifacts` | Success writes outputs/stats/hint; inspect does not print runnable hint; unsupported removes stale executable models |
| Copyable TLC invocation | `cmd/gotla/hint_test.go` | JAR lookup, absolute paths, quotes, and setup guidance are correct |
| Missing required checker | `tests/main_test.go`: `TestTLCPrerequisites` and `TestMain` | Optional absent JAR permits local skips; required absent/invalid path fails |

The backward slice is intentionally conservative; its tests do not claim precise
postdominator analysis or general pointer analysis. Backend validation is currently
partial; generic schema validation/versioning remains M3 work.

## Actual TLC outcomes: 33 checks

All cases are in [tests/tlc_test.go](../tests/tlc_test.go). Tests assert the expected
message and whether the checker exits successfully; output substring checks alone
are not treated as sufficient evidence.

### Eight examples: `TestTLCExamples`

| Examples | Expected TLC result |
|---|---|
| `unbuffered`, `buffered`, `select`, `mutex`, `waitgroup`, `sequential` | Completed with no error |
| `deadlock` | Deadlock |
| `unknown` (explicit `strings.HasPrefix` contract) | Possible deadlock through abstract predicate |

### Nineteen edge cases: `TestTLCBlockingAndErrors`

| Cases | Expected TLC result |
|---|---|
| `nil-receive`, `nil-send`, `buffer-full` | Deadlock |
| `nil-close`, `closed-send`, `double-close` | Synchronization-error invariant violation |
| `closed-drain` | No error; closed receive/drain remains possible |
| `main-exit` | No error; main return ends all workers |
| `select-ready-no-default`, `select-nil-default`, `select-exact-dispatch` | No error; readiness and dispatch exclude invalid alternatives |
| `select-closed-send` | Synchronization-error invariant violation |
| `select-rendezvous` | No error |
| `select-self-no-rendezvous` | Deadlock; one process cannot match itself |
| `mutex-lock-twice` | Deadlock |
| `mutex-invalid-unlock` | Synchronization-error invariant violation |
| `mutex-cross-process-unlock` | No error; Go mutexes are not goroutine-owned |
| `waitgroup-negative` | Synchronization-error invariant violation |
| `waitgroup-blocked` | Deadlock |

### One branch commitment case: `TestTLCAbstractBranchCommitsBeforeBlocking`

An unknown main predicate can commit to an unmatched send instead of returning.
TLC must find a deadlock; an always-enabled skip must not hide the blocked branch.

### Five registered-offer cases: `TestTLCRegisteredOffersAndSelectDefault`

| Case | Expected TLC result |
|---|---|
| `default-before-poised-send` | Deadlock reachable when worker chooses default before parent registers send |
| `default-before-blocking-select` | Deadlock reachable before peer registers its select alternatives |
| `blocking-select-pair` | No error; blocking multi-case selects can rendezvous |
| `two-default-selects-never-rendezvous` | No error; no invented rendezvous between two nonblocking polls |
| `registered-select-closed` | No error; a registered receive can complete after close |

## Check workflow regressions (M2)

The original 33 checks above remain unchanged. Additional workflow tests cover:

| Contract | Evidence | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| Real end-to-end CLI/TLC outcomes | `cmd/gotla/check_test.go`: `TestCheckTLCIntegration` | Real pass/deadlock/invariant outcomes have matching gotla statuses/exits, artifact hashes, provenance, and source candidates; tiny deadline is incomplete |
| Checker outcome authentication | `internal/checker/protocol_test.go` | Framed completion/outcome and exit code must agree; prose-only, conflicting, truncated, and unknown-error output never passes |
| Resource and subprocess handling | `internal/checker/runner_test.go` | Shell-free Java stand-in exercises timeout, log limit, memory exhaustion, tool failure, and cancellation; logs remain bounded and workspace is cleaned |
| Setup and options | Same file | Missing JAR/Java and invalid resource options fail explicitly |
| Failed extraction and stale results | `cmd/gotla/check_test.go` | Load failure, unsupported source, cancelled analysis, and missing tool replace/invalidate old success; `analyze` also removes previous checker artifacts |
| Writer isolation and partial output | `internal/artifact/directory_test.go` and CLI lock tests | Concurrent writers cannot modify current results; unknown directory contents are not recursively removed; temporary writes are cleaned |
| Result separation | `check_test.go`, `protocol_test.go` | Extraction precision is independent of checker status; exit mapping is stable; argument errors do not start/overwrite a run |

Fake-Java subprocess tests are control-path tests, not actual TLC semantic evidence.
Source candidates are intentionally not a complete trace replay/causality proof.

## Fail-closed extraction

All following groups are in [tests/analysis_test.go](../tests/analysis_test.go).
They assert unsupported extraction and failure to emit executable TLA+.

| Test group | Cases |
|---|---|
| `TestUnsupportedIsNeverExecutable` | Dynamic capacity; loops/recursion; unavailable effects (including discarded results); dynamic calls; channel/goroutine/unknown initialization; defer/panic; unresolved fields; changing captures; Mutex copying; WaitGroup reuse/concurrent Add; RWMutex |
| `TestSynchronizationIdentityRequiresDominatingInitialization` | Future-store send/close, store after spawn/capture, conditional initialization; a dominating-store positive control remains supported |
| `TestUnsafeSynchronizationMutationRejected` | Mutex/WaitGroup state mutation, casts, helper and initializer unsafe effects; an unused unsafe function positive control remains supported |

## Known coverage limits and next additions

- These are small finite examples, not an exhaustive equivalence proof or a
  differential reference interpreter. Successful tests do not prove global soundness.
- CI provisions a pinned toolchain/checker; other platforms, Go versions, and TLC
  releases do not yet have a compatibility matrix.
- Model size baselines are IR counts. TLC state-space counts and performance are
  logged, not frozen across platforms/versions or enforced as performance guarantees.
- A completed host CI run and branch-protection configuration are external evidence;
  workflow presence alone proves neither.
- Normal source decoding, third-party effect-summary coverage, generic malformed-IR
  validation, and source-path collisions need dedicated follow-up in their milestones.
- M4 must add semantics-specific positive, deadlocking/error, and rejection cases
  before admitting synchronization fields, defers, or proved finite loops. Existing
  rejection tests must not simply be deleted without replacement evidence.
